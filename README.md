Lista de algoritmos en JS, todos realizados por mi atendiendo a la petición de enunciado, algunas soluciones estarán mejor y otras peor, pero no he usado en ningun caso recursos externos.

- SYMMETRIC DIFFERENCE

The mathematical term "symmetric difference" of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the two sets, but not in both

- INVENTORY UPDATE

Update the current existing inventory item quantities (in arr1).
If an item cannot be found, add the new item and quantity into the inventory array.
The returned inventory array should be in alphabetical order by item.

- NO REPEATS PLEASE

Coming soon

- PAIRWISE

Find element pairs whose sum equal the second argument arg and return the sum of their indices.
Once an element has been used it cannot be reused to pair with another element.

- BUBBLE SORT 

The bubble sort method starts at the beginning of an unsorted array and 'bubbles up' unsorted values towards the end, iterating through the array until it is completely sorted. It does this by comparing adjacent items and swapping them if they are out of order. The method continues looping through the array until no swaps occur at which point the array is sorted.

- SELECTION SORT

Selection sort works by selecting the minimum value in a list and swapping it with the first value in the list. It then starts at the second position, selects the smallest value in the remaining list, and swaps it with the second element. It continues iterating through the list and swapping elements until it reaches the end of the list.

- INSERTION SORT

This method works by building up a sorted array at the beginning of the list. It begins the sorted array with the first element. Then it inspects the next element and swaps it backwards into the sorted array until it is in sorted position. It continues iterating through the list and swapping new items backwards into the sorted portion until it reaches the end.

- QUICK SORT

In this method, a pivot value is chosen in the original array. The array is then partitioned into two subarrays of values less than and greater than the pivot value. We then combine the result of recursively calling the quick sort algorithm on both sub-arrays. This continues until the base case of an empty or single-item array is reached, which we return. The unwinding of the recursive calls return us the sorted array.
