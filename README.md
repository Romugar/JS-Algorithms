- PAIRWISE

Find element pairs whose sum equal the second argument arg and return the sum of their indices.
Once an element has been used it cannot be reused to pair with another element.

- BUBBLE SORT 

The bubble sort method starts at the beginning of an unsorted array and 'bubbles up' unsorted values towards the end, iterating through the array until it is completely sorted. It does this by comparing adjacent items and swapping them if they are out of order. The method continues looping through the array until no swaps occur at which point the array is sorted.
